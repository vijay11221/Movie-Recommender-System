## Overview

This project is a movie recommender system built using **Streamlit**. It lets users search for their favorite movies or get a **"Surprise Me"** suggestion. The app fetches live movie details—like posters, trailers, ratings, cast, and more—using the **TMDB API**. It also displays trending movies and tracks your recently viewed films. Simply put, it helps you discover movies that match your taste through an easy-to-use, interactive interface.

## Learning Journey 🗺️

I built this project out of a love for movies and a desire to dive into machine learning in a practical way. Here’s a glimpse into my journey:

- **Inspiration:**  
  I’ve always been passionate about movies, and I wanted to create something that not only recommends films but also tells a story through data. Merging my interests in cinema and technology felt like the perfect creative outlet.

- **Why I Made It:**  
  I set out to design a system that could give personalized movie suggestions by leveraging real-time data and machine learning. I also wanted to experiment with deep learning using the MNIST dataset to sharpen my skills and explore new techniques.

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - **API Key Integration:** One major challenge was choosing the right API for movie data. I had a better IMDb option available, but due to licensing and cost constraints, I opted to use TMDB. Integrating TMDB’s API and managing its rate limits pushed me to learn more about API integration and error handling.  
  - **Balancing Complexity & Usability:** I had to find the right balance between a robust, feature-rich system and a clean, user-friendly interface.  
  - **Model Tuning:** Fine-tuning the deep learning model to achieve high accuracy involved a lot of trial and error, pushing me to learn more about early stopping and data augmentation techniques.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - **API Integration:** Seamlessly connecting with external APIs (like TMDB) to fetch live movie data.  
  - **Web Development:** Building an interactive and user-friendly interface with Streamlit.  
  - **Deep Learning:** Hands-on experience in constructing, training, and optimizing a CNN with TensorFlow and Keras.  
  - **Data Handling:** Mastering data preprocessing and visualization to simplify complex concepts.

- **The Value It Adds:**  
  This project isn’t just a technical exercise—it’s a story of blending creativity with technology. It deepened my understanding of real-world problem-solving through machine learning and continues to inspire me to explore, learn, and share knowledge.

Every step of this journey has enriched my skills and reinforced my belief that learning is best when it’s fun, creative, and shared.

## Installation🛠 

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hk-kumawat/Movie-Recommender-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-System
   ```

2. **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Your TMDB API Key:**
   - Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file.
   - Add your TMDB API key:
     ```toml
     [tmdb]
     api_key = "your_api_key_here"
     ```
   - Alternatively, set your TMDB API key as an environment variable.

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

<br> 

## Usage🚀

### Running the Streamlit App
